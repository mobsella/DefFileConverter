# DefFileConverter
converting json file to Def file

This project is written in python, it converts is designed to convert verilog gate level netlist into a DEF file.
Def(design exchange format) file is used to represent the physical layout of an IC in an ASCII format.  We use DEF format and LEF format  to represent the complete physical layout of an integrated circuit during the design.

How it works: first: download the lef file and the JSON file gate level netlist generated by the yosys system in the same directory with the DefConv.py file then run the python code

limitations: All nets information are  not in the written the output file due to lack of information
